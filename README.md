# ios-capstone
This is the final project in my iOS course I am taking through Coursera and taught by Meta.
 Overall its not supposed to be rocket science, but instead a demonstration of what i have learned in the course. 
 Any feedback you have would be much appreciated. Feel free to shoot me an email at:
