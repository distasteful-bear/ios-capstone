# ios-capstone
This project was originally created for my certificate in iOS dev from Meta. 
After I concluded the course, I decided to host the project publically and continue making progress
since I am currently not too happy with it. 

Any reccomendations or advice would be great.

As of last commit, here are the highest priority tasks:
- Search bar is ugly and non-functional.
- the coloring of the UI feels like a strange combination of flat, boring, and too busy?
- the structure is in place for search and sort functionality, I have yet to complete the implementation.
- some of the menu Items do not seem to have valid images. I need to trouble shoot how the data is pulled
or its storage methods for bugs. Additionally a placeholder image would be a pleasant change from the black block as of now.
- the Hero on the menu page has been thrown together quickly and could use some reworking to better utilize the space.
- custom fonts would be much appreciated. The logo clashes with the system font.
